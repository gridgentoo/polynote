# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

Polynote welcomes contributions of all kinds from the open source community. 

## Contributing Code

If you are interested in contributing to Polynote, we'd love to hear from you! Drop us a line
in our [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/polynote/polynote).

You can contribute code through GitHub by forking [the repository](https://github.com/polynote/polynote) 
and sending a pull request. When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and 
style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

Website contributions are also accepted for our [website](https://polynote.org) at 
[its repository](https://github.com/polynote/polynote.github.io)

If you'd like to contribute a pull request, but you're not sure what to work on, look for
[issues](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/issues) labelled "good first issue".

## Issues and Documentation

You can contribute to the Polynote project without writing a single line of code! 
We also need help with writing and maintaining documentation, and with user testing. 

Documentation pull requests can be submitted to the main repository (you'll find the documentation in markdown 
format in the `docs` directory [here](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/tree/master/docs)).

We'd also appreciate [issue reports](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/issues) if you run into trouble using the 
software.

## Community
